# Overview

Within two weeks, I set out to create a program for tracking events and dailing planning in Java. Going into the project, I knew that I would need several classes in order to accomplish everything I had in mind. With the project, I sought to become more familiar with Java as well as strengthen my understanding of object oriented programming. 

Unshackled was initially intended to be a program to help the user track their daily schedule and earn "points" for every hour they worked, which would then allow them to spend said points and "buy" relaxation time. Ideally, the program would have featured a functioning User Interface as well, helping strengthen my skills in that regard.
Sadly however, I came to realize that such a project was rather unfeasable with my limited knowledge in a mere two weeks. However, in those two weeks I was able to gain a better understanding of Java and object oriented programming. I also managed to create a simple, even crude notification screen using Swing.

# Development Environment

I wrote the program in VSCode and used javac and Maven for compiling. 

AS mentioned, the program was written in Java and used the openJDK available from Oracle.

I also used google's GSON package for serialization and desirialzation of JSON data.

# Future Work

As I mentioned above, I sadly was not able to achieve everything I wanted to in the 2 week timeframe. However, should I return to the project, here is what I would focus on:

- Add point calculation and "purchasing" of relaxation time.
- Create specific event types within the program with attached amounts of points/hr
- Create a UI which would enable the user to view daily and weekly schedules.
- Allow users to change settings via a config file.
- Allow users to set notifications which would pop up on their screen before an event.
